# MultiPics
> MultiPics is a free stock photo search app built for creatives and marketers that consolidates the image search results from the top three free stock photo sources of Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay. This makes finding just the right image asset faster and more convenient. After entering a search query, the app requests ten photos at a time from each of the three APIs. The user is then able to drag and drop images to rearrange and compare them side-by-side. This makes searching and comparing image assets faster than opening up dozens of browser tabs and prevents the user from having to download the images locally in order to visually compare their features.

## Local Setup
#### Server Rails Backend API
In the project directory, run:
* `bundle install`
* `rails s`
* Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to ensure the app is running in the browser.
* Once the server is running revert back to the instructions in the [React Frontend Repo](https://github.com/katrpilar/free-stock-react)<br>
